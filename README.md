# Minecraft Lag Tests

All tests are run on my own laptop, with Intel Core i7-7700HQ @ 2.80GHz, 4GB RAM dedicated to Minecraft and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050.

All tests are run 10 times, and averaged - the full experiment data is visible in the individual files. The Minecraft version is completely default Minecraft, with just the carpet mod (and the fabric loader) installed, to allow me to access lag data.
